# Release notes

## v3.1.0

### Added

- Added `OnSceneLoadEventNode` that will be triggered during scene loading before placholders' mapping. If marked as coroutine will wait the flows to finish while in fade in.
- Added `OnSceneSetupEventNode` that will be triggered during scene setup. If marked as coroutine will wait the flows to finish while in fade in.
- Added `OnSceneSetupCompletedEventNode` that will be triggered after the setup fadeout is completed.
- Added scale on `InteractablePlaceholder` in manipulable mode (UX feelds since there is no bounding box).
- Added color picker and non proportional scale to `InteractablePaceholder` in contextual menu mode (non proportialScale needs manipulation mode to work properly).

## Fixed

- Fixed an issue of the Addressables configuration window not updating properly the load and build paths of the Addressables groups.
- Fixed an issue of the Addressables configuration window not updating the value of a profile variable if such variable was defined but empty.
