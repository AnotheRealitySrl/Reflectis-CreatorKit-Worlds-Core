# Release notes

## v3.4.0

### Added

- Added `GetCMUserByIDNode` to get a CMUser data by using its ID.
- Added `URLImageToTexture` to apply a sprite to an image from a URL link.
- Added `ProfileImageURL` to the exposed data of the already existing `CollectPlayerDataNode` node.
- Added new visual scripting node `InitializePlaceholder`. It can be used to initialize the placeholder component of a GameObject that has been instantiated dynamically.
- Added `ConstraintSource` type to visual scripting type library.

### Changed

- Updated visual scripting node `EnableOtherCharacters` so that it uses the new method `EnableOtherAvatarsMeshes` from the AvatarSystem. The node now works as intended (up until now it was considered as not implemented).
 
## v3.3.1

### Fixed

- Fixed synced variables parameters (`OnSyncedVariableInit`,`OnSyncedVariableEventUnit`,`OnSyncedVariablesEventNodes`), removed unused value input and unuesed isSynced variable

## v3.3.0

### Added

- Added `OnSelectedGenericInteractableChangeNode` that will be triggered whenever the current selected generic interactable changes, and its argument is a reference to the new selected item. The event is also fired when the user clicks on an empty area, in which case the reference is null.
- Added `SetFirstPersonCameraModeNode` and `SetThirdPersonCameraModeNode`. They can be used to switch the character controller to first person or third person view respectively.

## v3.2.0

### Added

- Added `startPaused` variable to `BigScreenPlaceholder` to switch off autoplay on start.
- Added `onVideoPlayed` and `onVideoPaused` callbacks in `BigScreenPlaceholder`.
- Added `OnVideoPlayedEventUnit` and `OnVideoPausedEventUnit` scripts to provide callbacks for video player play/pause events when triggered by visual scripting.

## v3.1.3

### Added

- Added localization logic to write and translate custom keys.

### Fixed

- Fixed the configuration of the scale of the environmental dashboard (now support also the collider the dashboard itself).

## v3.1.2

### Fixed

- Added cache for placeholder types in `SceneComponentsMapper`, to improve loading times and avoid operation involving reflection when possible.

## v3.1.1

### Fixed

- Fixed missing validity check of build and load paths in the top-level Addressables settings, which may result in catalogs being built in the wrong folder.

## v3.1.0

### Added

- Added `OnSceneLoadEventNode` that will be triggered during scene loading before placholders' mapping. If marked as coroutine will wait the flows to finish while in fade in.
- Added `OnSceneSetupEventNode` that will be triggered during scene setup. If marked as coroutine will wait the flows to finish while in fade in.
- Added `OnSceneSetupCompletedEventNode` that will be triggered after the setup fadeout is completed.
- Added scale on `InteractablePlaceholder` in manipulable mode (UX feelds since there is no bounding box).
- Added color picker and non proportional scale to `InteractablePaceholder` in contextual menu mode (non proportialScale needs manipulation mode to work properly).
- Added `OnSyncedVariableInit` node that will be triggered when entering the scene. It outputs the value of the synced variable, whether or not it has changed and an event.

## Fixed

- Fixed an issue of the Addressables configuration window not updating properly the load and build paths of the Addressables groups.
- Fixed an issue of the Addressables configuration window not updating the value of a profile variable if such variable was defined but empty.
- Fixed issue of `automaticSetup` and `isNetworking` fields of `InteractablePlaceholder` not being shown in the inspector.
- Fixed the synced position of the synced object when player enter the environment.
- Improved `InteractablePlaceholder`'s custom inspector.
- Disabled CRC check option in Addressables groups.

## v3.0.0

### Changed

- An `InteractablePlaceholder` now accepts viual scripting state machines instead of scriptable actions to handle the generic interaction.
- Improved name conventions of public variables and properties of existing visual scripting nodes.

### Added

- Added `ScreenName` field to `BigScreenPlaceholder` to identify big screens by a custom name instead of its `GameObjsect`'s name.
- Added new visual scripting nodes: interactable behaviours blocking by selection, pan character camera, disable character mesh, teleport player, open-close tutorial.
- Added visual scripting nodes which collect data from current event, current environment and current user.
- Added an `ActionPlayerMap` defining XR inputs (useful for recognizing user input by visual scripting).
- Added visual scripting nodes which detect manipulation start/end of a `Manipulable` object.
- Implemented a utility to auto-setup visual scripting nodes.

### Removed

- Removed awaitable scriptable actions in favour of visual scripting machines.
- Removed legacy `ToastInteractablePlaceholder`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `NetworkPlaceholdersManager` editor window scrolling.
- Fixed `SyncedObject`'s custom inspector not showing the info of the base class.
- Improved `InteractablePlaceholder`'s custom inspector.

## v2.0.0

### Changed

- Massive SPACS -> Reflectis refactor.
- Reorganized package structure.
- Reimplemented `BigScreen` placeholder (with prefab) for an easier configuration and improved flexibility.
- Reimplemented `TeleportPoint` logic (now called `SceneChanger`).
- Reimplemented `ScriptableActions` to support async/await paradigm, and to support the selected interactable as a parameter of the action.

### Added

- `INetworkedPlaceholder` interface to distinguish network placeholder from local one.
- Added an environmental dashboard prefab with placeholder.
- `InteractionPlaceholder` which supports the interaction provided by the `SDK.Interaction` module.
- Add first integration with visual scripting, with nodes for ownership management, variables syncronization and invoking of networked events.
- WebView placeholders (both for screen-space and 3D WebViews).
- Added window to configure network placeholder IDs.
- `SpawnAddressable` placeholder for spawning addressable assets.
- `InteractableOwnershipPlaceholder` for ownership management of an interactable object.
- `HelpSpawnObjectPlaceholder` which allows for spawning an object on help system calls.
- `GoToPreviousEventButtonAdder` which allows to add a button to the menu that teleports the player to the previous event.
- `GoToPreviousEventOnCollisionPlaceholder` which allows to create a teleport point to the previous event.
- `MascotteNameSetCheckPlaceholder` which allows to check if the mascotte name has been set at scene start. If not, it calls the help at start.
- `RPMAvatarWebViewButtonPlaceholder` which allows to open the `ReadyPlayerMeWebView`.
